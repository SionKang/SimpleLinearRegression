# SimpleLinearRegression
implementation of simple linear regression framework through Python

In this program, it explores an aspect of machine learning called simple linear regression. Using the sample data "Salary Data" that has an x-variable of "years of experience" and y-variable of "per year salary", the program aims to predict the relationship between the two. The data was split into training data and testing data to do so: training set used to find optimal parameters a0 and a1 of the linear equation, testing set used to compare accuracy between actual output and predicted output. Instead of using the simple linear regression class provided by Spyder, the mathematical process was thoroughly outlined hand by hand. This is reflected from the mathematics done in code of the cost function and gradient descent. To further understand the mathematics behind the simple linear regression, refer to the "SimpleLinearRegressionReport" file.
